# 🎮 Python Platformer Game with Procedural Level Generation

## 📌 Introduction

This project is a **Python-based Mario-style 2D platformer game** that blends classic platformer mechanics with **AI-powered procedural level generation**. The player controls a character who runs, jumps across platforms, avoids obstacles, and collects items while navigating dynamically generated levels.

Unlike traditional platformer games with fixed levels, this game generates **new levels every time it is played**, ensuring that no two gameplay experiences are the same. The levels vary in terrain structure, background environments, obstacles, and collectible placements, increasing replayability and challenge.

The game is developed using **Python 3.x and Pygame**, making use of sprite handling, collision detection, animations, and real-time user input. Procedural level generation is implemented using AI-based logic that analyzes platform spacing, difficulty balance, and level flow to automatically create playable and engaging environments.

This project demonstrates how **artificial intelligence can be integrated into game development** to automate content creation, a technique widely used in modern games like *Minecraft* and *Spelunky*.
